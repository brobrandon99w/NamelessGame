This is a simple Unity game I created to learn Unity and game development. You can pick up various items which are added to your inventory on the right-hand side of the screen. These items can be used or dropped on the ground. You can attack with your fists or with firearms. A flashlight can be used to illuminate the dark room. The playable character's animations reflect the actions you are doing (walking, aiming a firearm, using a flashlight, reloading, etc.). Hovering over items in your inventory reveals tooltips which describe the items.
